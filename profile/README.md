## Overview

Firefly is an open-source observability framework. It provides key insights into serverless function health through the use of metrics and traces. Firefly automates function instrumentation and the deployment of a telemetry pipeline, ultimately presenting your function data in an easy-to-use dashboard. You can use it to:

* Get a clear overview of how your serverless functions are performing
* See how a request flows through your serverless infrastructure with distributed tracing
* Navigate through a sea of request data and pin down problem requests with greater ease
* Analyse request latency in greater depth; see if a downstream service is causing an issue rather than the function itself

*Firefly currently only supports AWS lamba functions*
